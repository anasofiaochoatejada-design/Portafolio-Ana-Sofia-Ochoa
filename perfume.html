    <h1>Perfume- Eternal Transparency</h1>

    <p>This project consists of a perfume bottle
inspired by the artist Yin Young Yu, renowned
for her sculptures that explore human emotion
contained within transparent forms, symbolizing
the fragility of being.

Beyond its function as a container, this
proposal aims to merge art and functionality,
transforming the act of applying perfume into a
sensory and emotional experience.


Eternal Transparency by Young is a perfume whose
bottle abstractly represents the inner emotions of
people—specifically, young people during the adolescent
phase. </p>
