    <h2>Who am I? </h2>
    <p> I’m a product designer with the soul of an
artist and Colombian roots, which has given
me a unique and sensitive perspective on
aesthetics, functionality, and cultural diversity.
My self-taught background in art has sharpened
my eye for detail and visual intuition, while
my training in product design has equipped
me with the tools to turn ideas into real,
responsible, and well-crafted solutions.
I create products that not only work,
but also respect the environment and
connect with people on a deeper level. </p>
